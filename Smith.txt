Tom Smith
Strengths:
Identifies multiple notations associated with the derivative of a function. Demonstrating mastery of using limits to define continuity and evaluating limit expressions using l'Hopital's rule.Uses strong foundational skills to go about computations methodically and systematically, especially when computing derivatives.Written communication is clear and organized vertically in a step-by-step manner.Demonstrating mastery of the algebra involved in computing derivative rules but sometimes gets stuck when trying to create a graphical representation on the calculator.Looking forward, I encourage you to speak up with questions when you notice that you can not find special features of graphs on the calculator (intersections, max/mins, intercepts, and derivatives).
Area for Growth:
On modeling problems that require an explanation beyond the numerical answer, make sure to include units and provide reasoning in context.Developing great habits when it comes to checking work for mistakes. Now, consider speaking up when you notice that you've used a different method during group work. Even if you come to the same answer, it would benefit everyone to talk through the efficiency of different methods. For example, what connections can you draw between your process for solving related rates problems and the alternate method of differentiating with respect to time?
Personal cIt is clear that you have been working hard to develop new skills and improve in your academic pursuits, and I am impressed by the strides you have made.
