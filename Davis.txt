Strengths:
Demonstrating mastery of the algebra involved in computing derivative rules but sometimes gets stuck when trying to create a graphical representation on the calculator.Looking forward, I encourage you to speak up with questions when you notice that you can not find special features of graphs on the calculator (intersections, max/mins, intercepts, and derivatives).
Area for Growth:
Identifies multiple notations associated with the derivative of a function. Demonstrating mastery of using limits to define continuity and evaluating limit expressions using l'Hopital's rule.Uses strong foundational skills to go about computations methodically and systematically, especially when computing derivatives.Written communication is clear and organized vertically in a step-by-step manner.On modeling problems that require an explanation beyond the numerical answer, make sure to include units and provide reasoning in context.Developing great habits when it comes to checking work for mistakes. Now, consider speaking up when you notice that you've used a different method during group work. Even if you come to the same answer, it would benefit everyone to talk through the efficiency of different methods. For example, what connections can you draw between your process for solving related rates problems and the alternate method of differentiating with respect to time?
Personal cYour eagerness to learn and your commitment to your goals are truly inspiring, and they set you apart from your peers.
Grade comments:
While this may not be the grade you were hoping for, I encourage you to take this as an opportunity to reflect on your performance and to identify areas where you can improve. Your grade reflects your current understanding of the course material, and I believe that with some extra effort, you can achieve better results in the future.
