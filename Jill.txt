Strengths:
Identifies multiple notations associated with the derivative of a function. Demonstrating mastery of using limits to define continuity and evaluating limit expressions using l'Hopital's rule.On modeling problems that require an explanation beyond the numerical answer, make sure to include units and provide reasoning in context.Developing great habits when it comes to checking work for mistakes. Now, consider speaking up when you notice that you've used a different method during group work. Even if you come to the same answer, it would benefit everyone to talk through the efficiency of different methods. For example, what connections can you draw between your process for solving related rates problems and the alternate method of differentiating with respect to time?
Area for Growth:
Uses strong foundational skills to go about computations methodically and systematically, especially when computing derivatives.Written communication is clear and organized vertically in a step-by-step manner.Demonstrating mastery of the algebra involved in computing derivative rules but sometimes gets stuck when trying to create a graphical representation on the calculator.Looking forward, I encourage you to speak up with questions when you notice that you can not find special features of graphs on the calculator (intersections, max/mins, intercepts, and derivatives).
Personal cYour eagerness to learn and your commitment to your goals are truly inspiring, and they set you apart from your peers.
Grade comments:
While this may not be the grade you were hoping for, it is still a solid performance, and I commend you for your hard work and dedication throughout the semester.
